  "description": "Losing hurts. What makes it worse is opening a browser and immediately getting dunked on — headlines, hot takes, fan reactions, YouTube thumbnails with crying faces. Arsenal Sanity Shield makes it stop.\n\nInstall it, forget it. When Arsenal lose or draw, the extension detects the result and quietly hides football content across the web — articles, YouTube channels, social posts. When they win, everything's back to normal.\n\nBuilt the free version for Arsenal fans. The premium tier (Football Sanity Shield) extends it to any English club across six competitions.",
