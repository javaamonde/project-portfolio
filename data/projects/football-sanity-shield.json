When your team loses or draws, the extension quietly hides football content across the web. No results, no hot takes, no crying-face thumbnails. You just browse normally.\n\nSupports any English club across six competitions \u2014 Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, Conference League, FA Cup, and League Cup. Per-competition toggles let you choose whether to block on loss only, or loss and draw.",
